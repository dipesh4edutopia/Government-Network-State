When I say Utopia (An Ideal Civilization) 2.0 the obvious question is where's 1.0? This question arises because are by default ungrateful creatures we fail to appreciate

 Utopia 1.0
- Democracy
- Constitution
- Monopolization of Violence by the state
- More food than we can consume, amazing gadgets, Education available to sincere seekers online, Better Health Metrics than anytime in history

To Imagine GNS Utopia 2.0 Let's First Imagine the Utopia in All fields and then notice a pattern.

## [[Z Utopia In all Fields]] 

## Applying the Law of Attraction for the Entire Humanity

Applying the Law of Attraction to create a utopia in each sector requires a shift in focus, energy, and mindset towards what we *want to achieve*, not on what we aim to avoid or fear. The Law of Attraction is based on the principle that focusing on positive goals, emotions, and outcomes attracts similar energies and experiences into our lives. By visualizing a future of abundance, health, harmony, and opportunity across all fields, we actively attract solutions, connections, and innovations that align with these ideals. Our commitment to focusing on what we _want_ sets the tone for our actions, decisions, and ultimately, the world we build. The Law of Attraction, then, becomes not just a personal tool, but a collective force for manifesting a balanced, equitable, and enlightened society.

## The Hardware and Software of making all Utopia's Possible

What could make these possible? Small group of highly motivated selfless People. If their ideas, beliefs, knowledge and networks are the software, they themselves were the CPU equivalent of the Hardware. People whose compassion for the mankind was bigger than the bitterness they encountered in their struggle. We call these people P.R.I.M.E. people. We have an entire chapter devoted to this concept but right now, lets understand the basics. 

P - Philanthropy
R - Risk Takers
I - Integrity
M - Merit
E - Ethics



People taking this new identity over all the existing identities they carry will become a powerful force in creating all Utopias. Why create a new identity? Because people with similar identities form collaborations, barters and social capital that could make Utopia's Possible.


In India we transcended the identities of religion, language, culture and caste to carve out a single functional entity. In Europe, decades of war and hostility was made peace with and European Union was formed. Human Beings do transcend identities they themselves create. It just takes time. This book is about creation of a new Identity, discovering the paradigm shifting economics  the MPIs forming a GNS who collectively.

## GNS Utopia 2.0

So finally what constitutes GNS Utopia 2.0, something that would lead to achieving all the above Utopias?

It is the fulfilment of these 3 Conditions:
1. Financial Freedom for 1 Million P.R.I.M.E. People - Leading to 2
2. High and Strategic Social Capital, Co-Operation, Co-Ordination and V-Lancing*,I-Pollination* Amongst MPI People leading to 3.
3. Thousands Of High Value Projects Implemented across Education, Healthcare, Environment, Affordable Housing etc. 

!What constitutes Utopia 3.0?
- Global Warming Solved.
- Many projects in the above Utopias Initiated.
- No Work necessary for Basic Needs for every Human Being.
- A Huge Human Capital Liberated to solve Humanities bigger problems.

Why not directly aim for Utopia 3.0?

If at the same level of conscience we financially free every person, there will be nothing but chaos in the world.

This book serves as a roadmap, detailing the philosophies, strategies, economics, tech and practical steps necessary to realize this vision. It invites readers to not only understand these concepts but to become active participants in shaping a better world.
