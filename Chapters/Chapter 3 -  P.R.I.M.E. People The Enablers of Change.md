Every community, every nation, every region, every race.. the binding force for all people is identity. We share a similar identity, same philosophies hence we can connect, co-operate, communicate, perhaps even barter better. The same identities when taken into a bigger picture cause tensions, disagreements and in worst cases even wars.

What if the solution to this madness was not to invent a technology but a very thoughtfully crafted Identity. The identity of P.R.I.M.E. which stands for

P - Philantrophic Mindset or simply Selflessness
R - Risk Taking ability 
I - Integrity 
M - Merit in their field or multiple fields together
E - Ethics

Rare resource isn't Capital, Rare resource is PRIME People. GNS seeks not just to empower but to cultivate these gems.

It is a rare identity honestly agreed. All legendary identities of nations, religions which in the past served a useful purpose. And their founder's were the only ones with the epitome (fullest) of their identity, they found followers who saw great benefits to adopting such an identity and eventually their collective efforts shaped history.

Searching on Linkedin for the CXOs (CEOs CTOs CMOs), Policy think Tanks, Social Entrepreneurs, few Bureaucrats, few politicians of Environment, Education and Healthcare, Impact Investors we found ~10 Million People who fall into the P.R.I.M.E. category. 

<idea of image where we have linkedin Data for CXOs >

Imagine that  ~ 1 Million Believe in the idea of Government Network State, not just because it will create an impact, it just makes way more economic sense too. Who doesn't want a life that's filled with excitement, camaraderie (relationships) along with the basic luxuries and the promise of a much higher return in the future not just for themselves but overall for the world.

To understand the Intersection of All the Qualities and how they play out see the diagram below:

So is every P.R.I.M.E. Member equal, we learn from the success of capitalism that there is no bigger injustice than the equal treatment of Unequals.

This brings us to the P.R.I.M.E. Pyramid.

How will we decide if a particular person is a Tier I, II, III

This will be based on the past history and also the current potential of the candidate. A thorough screening for the tiers, its framework is currently an unsolved problem in GNS.

Societies where either the rich or the poor when they dominate, the result is often conflict and tyranny
-Aristotle

There are 3 Types of Votes possible in GNS

Populist Vote, where everyone in GNS gets an equal share.
Generalist Vote, where every Leader has a proportionate vote based on its tier.
Wisdom Vote, only those people who have the know how in that domain vote for it.

These rewards will be in the form of GNS Currencies and Dahi Handi Distribution Events (See respective chapters.)

If they have high impact, bless with more with resources such that they will have even better Impact.

Together we will make the most positive organized chaos
