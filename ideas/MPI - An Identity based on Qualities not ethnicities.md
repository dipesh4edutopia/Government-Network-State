Distributed Meritocracy - Merit attracts power not popularity, and distributed merit keeps each other in check.

**Meritocracy** 

MPI individuals are recognized for their skills, knowledge, and contributions rather than their socioeconomic background or connections. This merit-based recognition ensures that the most capable individuals lead initiatives, driving efficiency and innovation.

**Philanthropic Mindset** 
Beyond personal success, MPI people are motivated by the greater good. They actively seek opportunities to improve society, whether through volunteering, developing open-source projects, or mentoring others. Their altruism fuels the collective progress of the community.

**Integrity** 
Integrity ensures that actions align with ethical principles. MPI individuals uphold honesty, transparency, and accountability, fostering trust within the community and setting a standard for others to follow.
