### The Evolution of GNS

GNS began as a small group of three friends—passionate individuals with diverse perspectives but aligned values. Through countless discussions and relentless collaboration, the group expanded. Today, GNS has a humble membership of ~20 individuals, each dedicated to the mission of collective growth and shared purpose.

### The Decentralization Core Pact

At the heart of GNS lies a foundation of trust and mutual support. Among the most trusted members, a pact was established:

_"If one member achieves financial freedom, they will support the runway (financial needs) of other chosen members for at least two years."_

This pact ensures stability, allowing collaboration and innovation to flourish unencumbered by financial insecurity.
