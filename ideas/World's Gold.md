As of my last update in April 2023, the total value of all gold reserves worldwide can be estimated by considering the total amount of gold mined and its market price. Historically, an estimated total of around 200,000 metric tons of gold has been mined, a figure that includes gold used for investment, jewelry, industry, and held by central banks.

To estimate the value of these gold reserves, you would use the current market price of gold per troy ounce. Gold prices fluctuate due to market conditions, so the valuation can vary significantly over time. As an example, if the price of gold is approximately $2,000 USD per troy ounce, you can calculate the total value as follows:

- 1 metric ton of gold = 32,150.7 troy ounces
- Total gold mined = 200,000 metric tons

Therefore, the total ounces of gold mined would be 200,000 metric tons * 32,150.7 ounces/metric ton = 6,430,140,000 ounces.

At $2,000 per ounce, the total value of all gold reserves would be approximately:

6,430,140,000 ounces * $2,000/ounce = $12.86 trillion USD.

This is a rough approximation and the actual value would depend on the precise amount of gold mined and the current market price, both of which fluctuate.
