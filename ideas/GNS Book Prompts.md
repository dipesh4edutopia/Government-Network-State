We already saw the concept of [[Virtual Mind Main]]. Now with this virtual mind, you can primarily do 5 things.

1) Connect with exactly those people who share your values and complement you to accomplish your goals. [[Brainchain/Reference/Philosophy/Connect Module]]

2) Communicate during a meeting effectively. Both your virtual minds 'talk' to each other and chalk out exactly those points which would benefit you both. [[Brainchain/Reference/Philosophy/Communicate Module]]

3) Co-operate in mass numbers, using Nash Equilibrium know that co-operation is in your best interest and generate a lot of value for yourself and others. (This module is still in its infancy).

4) Incubate your ideas, projects and side-hustles in a larger community to increase the probability to get things done. [[Brainchain/Reference/Philosophy/Incubate Module]]

5) Barter strategically resulting in win-win barters. You can barter knowledge, skills and even assets like books.

Future:

Our virtual minds would guide us optimally to do better things. It doesn't mean Virtual Minds control us. It just means we overcome our limitations posed due to memory and cognitive biases.




I want you to get accustomed to the concepts of HUPSI, Centrism, Imagined Realities, PTP Economics, Conscious Trickle Down, Brainchain Tech Framework and Shared Second Brain. I will explain each one in detail now.
